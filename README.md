## About the course

> This course teaches students how to use mathematical modelling to support practical business management decisions. 
> The course will give an introduction to the use of the most common modelling techniques for deterministic optimisation, such as linear programming (LP), integer programming (IP), mixed-integer programming (MIP) and nonlinear programming (NLP). 
> Applications of these methods in logistics/operations, strategy, marketing, and finance will be demonstrated through exercises and using state-of-the-art software.


## Course content:


> * The concept of a mathematical programming model
> * Linear programming models and the importance of linearity
> * How to interpret model output
> * Multi-period planning models
> * Integer and mixed-integer models
> * Good and bad formulations
> * Non-linear models
> * Multi-objective models
> * Heuristics
> * Practical aspects of optimization


## Business applications:
> 
> This course is highly practical for real-world business management decisions. By teaching mathematical modeling techniques like linear programming (LP), integer programming (IP), and mixed-integer programming (MIP), it gives students powerful tools to solve complex optimization problems in various business domains.
> Few useful applications:
> * **Logistics and Operations:**
>
> Optimization can help streamline supply chain management, minimize transportation costs, or maximize production efficiency. Linear programming models are commonly used to determine the best allocation of resources like materials, time, or manpower in manufacturing and distribution. 
> * **Strategy:** 
>
> Integer and mixed-integer programming can assist in strategic decision-making. For instance, deciding which projects to invest in or how to optimize resource allocation across business units. Multi-objective models can help in balancing trade-offs between cost, profit, and risk.
> 
> * **Marketing:**
> 
> Optimization models can help with pricing strategies, budget allocation, or maximizing the return on marketing investments by modeling customer behavior and response. Nonlinear programming can be useful in customer segmentation and targeting.
>
> * **Finance:**
> 
> Portfolio optimization, risk management, and capital budgeting are areas where these techniques excel. Mixed-integer models help optimize investment decisions when some variables must take integer values, such as deciding whether to invest in a project or not.
>
>The course also covers heuristics, which are useful for solving large, complex problems that can’t be solved exactly. This can be valuable when time or computational power is limited. 
> Understanding good and bad formulations also equips you to avoid common pitfalls in optimization models, ensuring they run efficiently and provide accurate results.
